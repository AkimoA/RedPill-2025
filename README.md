## 🛠 Installation

### Option 1: Direct Installation
1. Download the latest `RedPill.saver` from [Releases](../../releases)
2. Double-click the `.saver` file to install
3. Open **System Settings** → **Desktop & Screen Saver**
4. Select **Red Pill** from the screensaver list

### Option 2: Manual Installation
1. Copy `RedPill.saver` to one of these locations:
   ```bash
   ~/Library/Screen Savers/          # User installation
   /Library/Screen Savers/           # System-wide installation
   ```
2. Open **System Settings** → **Desktop & Screen Saver**
3. Select **Red Pill** from the screensaver list

## 🔒 Security Notice

### "Screensaver can't be opened" Error

If you see this message: *"Screensaver can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software"*

**Solution:**
1. Open **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security**
2. Scroll down to **Security** section
3. Click **"Allow Anyway"** next to the RedPill.saver notification
4. Return to **Desktop & Screen Saver** settings
5. Select **Red Pill** again
6. Click **"Open Anyway"** when prompted

This is normal for unsigned screensavers and is safe to allow.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### legacyScreenSaver Process Issues
This version includes **automatic fixes** for the infamous `legacyScreenSaver` process that would consume CPU/memory after screensaver exit. The fixes are version-specific:

- **macOS Sonoma/Sequoia:** Uses proven `exit(0)` termination
- **macOS 26+ (Tahoe):** Uses delayed termination workaround


### Black Screen Issues
If the screensaver shows only a black screen:
1. Check **Privacy & Security** settings (see Security Notice above)
2. Ensure your Mac supports **Metal graphics**
3. Try restarting the **System Settings** app
4. Check **Console.app** for error messages

### Performance Issues
- The screensaver targets **60 FPS** but will adapt to your hardware
- On older machines, frame rate may be automatically reduced
- Memory usage should remain stable during long sessions

### 🎯 Take the Red Pill... 

*"This is your last chance. After this, there is no going back. You take the blue pill—the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill—you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes."*

**The Matrix has you... but now it runs properly on Apple Silicon.** 🚀
